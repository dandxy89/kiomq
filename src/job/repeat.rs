/// Repeat / scheduling policy for a job.
///
/// When a [`Repeat`] is set on a job via [`crate::JobOptions`]'s `repeat` field,
/// the queue automatically re-enqueues the job after each successful run according to
/// the policy.
///
/// | Variant | Behaviour |
/// |---------|-----------|
/// | `WithCron` | Re-run at the next cron-schedule occurrence. |
/// | `WithBackOff` | Re-run after a backoff-derived delay. |
/// | `Every { delay_ms, max_attempts }` | Re-run every `delay_ms` ms, up to `max_attempts` times (unlimited if `None`). |
/// | `Immediately(max_attempts)` | Re-run as quickly as possible until `max_attempts` is reached. |
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use kiomq::Repeat;
///
/// // Repeat every 10 seconds, at most 5 times.
/// let policy = Repeat::Every { delay_ms: 10_000, max_attempts: Some(5) };
/// ```
